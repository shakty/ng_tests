		<p>
		You just joined a community of artists who decided to prepare 
		<strong>3 (three)</strong> artistic exhibitions.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Your task as a player is to create <strong>1 (one)</strong> work of art, 
		and to select the best among the ones produced at each round. Each player is
		therefore at the same time an <em>artist</em> and an <em>art critic</em>.
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		The game is divided in three steps:
		
		<ol>
			<li>Produce a work of art</li>
			<li>Submit it to one of three exhibitions (named A, B, or C)</li>
			<li>Review the paintings produced by other artists </li>
		</ol>
		
		The three steps above are repeated for <strong>50 (fifty)</strong> rounds,
		and at the end of each you will be shown the works of art put on show on 
		the three exhibitions.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For participating in the game you will rewarded with <strong>0.75 CHF</strong>
		each time one of your works is exposed in one the three exhibitions.
